Moving bulk elements to boundary elements
Assuming that boundaries names are already Ok!
Leading bulk elementtype is 303
Trailing bulk elementtype is 202
There are 97 (out of 36306) lower dimensional elements.
Node 65 belongs to maximum of 9 elements
Found 80 side elements that have two parents.
Found correctly 97 side elements.
Parent elements were reordered up to index 36209.
Moved 36209 elements (out of 36306) to new positions
Successfully read the mesh from the Gmsh input file.
Using physical numbering of entities

Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
-------------------------------------------

Elmergrid saving data with method 2:
-------------------------------------
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory case.
Saving 18194 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 36209 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
Saving names info to mesh.names.
Saving entities info to entities.sif.
