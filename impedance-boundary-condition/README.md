## Verification of impedance boundary condition (work in progress)

The simulation setup is based on https://github.com/ElmerCSC/elmerfem/tree/devel/fem/tests/mgdyn_harmonic_wire_impedanceBC_circuit

The analytical solution is based on *E.J. Davies, Conduction and Induction Heating, IEE Power Engineering Series 11, 1990*.
