# Elmer verification

2D axisymmetric verification cases for Elmer FEM:

- Induction heating
- Heat conduction and radiation in concentric spheres

Both cases are solved numerically and analytically, deviations are <1%.

The project is developed and maintained by the [**Model experiments group**](https://www.ikz-berlin.de/en/research/materials-science/section-fundamental-description#c486) at the Leibniz Institute for Crystal Growth (IKZ).
