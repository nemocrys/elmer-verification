Output will be saved to file induction_verification.

Elmergrid loading data:
-----------------------
Format chosen using the first line: $MeshFormat
Gmsh version is 2.2
Loading mesh in Gmsh format 2.0 from file induction_verification.msh2
Allocating for 78923 knots and 157802 elements.
Physical groups of dimension 1 not supported in 3-dimensional mesh: ignoring group 5 "cylinder_surf"
Physical groups of dimension 1 not supported in 3-dimensional mesh: ignoring group 6 "outside_surfs"
Moving bulk elements to boundary elements
Leading bulk elementtype is 303
Trailing bulk elementtype is 202
There are 110 (out of 157802) lower dimensional elements.
Node 483 belongs to maximum of 9 elements
Found 42 side elements that have two parents.
Found correctly 110 side elements.
Parent elements were reordered up to index 157692.
Moved 157692 elements (out of 157802) to new positions
Successfully read the mesh from the Gmsh input file.
Using physical numbering of entities

Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
-------------------------------------------

Elmergrid saving data with method 2:
-------------------------------------
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory induction_verification.
Saving 78923 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 157692 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
Saving names info to mesh.names.
Saving entities info to entities.sif.
