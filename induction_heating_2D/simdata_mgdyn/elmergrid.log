Format chosen using the first line: $MeshFormat
Gmsh version is 2.2
Loading mesh in Gmsh format 2.0 from file induction_verification.msh2
Allocating for 78884 knots and 157724 elements.
Assuming maximum entity dim to be 2
Moving bulk elements to boundary elements
Leading bulk elementtype is 303
Trailing bulk elementtype is 202
There are 110 (out of 157724) lower dimensional elements.
Node 483 belongs to maximum of 9 elements
Found 42 side elements that have two parents.
Found correctly 110 side elements.
Parent elements were reordered up to index 157614.
Moved 157614 elements (out of 157724) to new positions
Successfully read the mesh from the Gmsh input file.
