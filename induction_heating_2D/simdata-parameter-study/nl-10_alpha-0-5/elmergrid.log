Elmergrid loading data:
-----------------------
Format chosen using the first line: $MeshFormat
Gmsh version is 2.2
Loading mesh in Gmsh format 2.0 from file ./simdata/induction_verification.msh2
Allocating for 323660 knots and 647124 elements.
Physical groups of dimension 1 not supported in 3-dimensional mesh: ignoring group 5 "cylinder_surf"
Physical groups of dimension 1 not supported in 3-dimensional mesh: ignoring group 6 "outside_surfs"
Moving bulk elements to boundary elements
Leading bulk elementtype is 303
Trailing bulk elementtype is 202
There are 335 (out of 647124) lower dimensional elements.
Node 1055 belongs to maximum of 9 elements
Found 175 side elements that have two parents.
Found correctly 335 side elements.
Parent elements were reordered up to index 646789.
Moved 646789 elements (out of 647124) to new positions
Successfully read the mesh from the Gmsh input file.

Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
-------------------------------------------

Elmergrid saving data with method 2:
-------------------------------------
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory ./simdata/induction_verification.
Saving 323660 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 646789 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
Saving names info to mesh.names.
Saving entities info to entities.sif.
