Elmergrid loading data:
-----------------------
Format chosen using the first line: $MeshFormat
Gmsh version is 2.2
Loading mesh in Gmsh format 2.0 from file ./simdata/induction_verification.msh2
Allocating for 20886 knots and 41720 elements.
Physical groups of dimension 1 not supported in 3-dimensional mesh: ignoring group 5 "cylinder_surf"
Physical groups of dimension 1 not supported in 3-dimensional mesh: ignoring group 6 "outside_surfs"
Moving bulk elements to boundary elements
Leading bulk elementtype is 303
Trailing bulk elementtype is 202
There are 84 (out of 41720) lower dimensional elements.
Node 3 belongs to maximum of 8 elements
Found 44 side elements that have two parents.
Found correctly 84 side elements.
Parent elements were reordered up to index 41636.
Moved 41636 elements (out of 41720) to new positions
Successfully read the mesh from the Gmsh input file.

Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
-------------------------------------------

Elmergrid saving data with method 2:
-------------------------------------
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory ./simdata/induction_verification.
Saving 20886 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 41636 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
Saving names info to mesh.names.
Saving entities info to entities.sif.
