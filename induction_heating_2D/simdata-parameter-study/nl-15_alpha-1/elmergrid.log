Gmsh version is 2.2
Loading mesh in Gmsh format 2.0 from file ./simdata/induction_verification.msh2
Allocating for 119673 knots and 239175 elements.
Physical groups of dimension 1 not supported in 3-dimensional mesh: ignoring group 5 "cylinder_surf"
Physical groups of dimension 1 not supported in 3-dimensional mesh: ignoring group 6 "outside_surfs"
Moving bulk elements to boundary elements
Leading bulk elementtype is 303
Trailing bulk elementtype is 202
There are 178 (out of 239175) lower dimensional elements.
Node 809 belongs to maximum of 9 elements
Found 88 side elements that have two parents.
Found correctly 178 side elements.
Parent elements were reordered up to index 238997.
Moved 238997 elements (out of 239175) to new positions
Successfully read the mesh from the Gmsh input file.
