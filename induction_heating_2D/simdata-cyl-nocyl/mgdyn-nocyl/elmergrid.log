Format chosen using the first line: $MeshFormat
Gmsh version is 2.2
Loading mesh in Gmsh format 2.0 from file induction_verification.msh2
Allocating for 81590 knots and 162994 elements.
Physical groups of dimension 1 not supported in 3-dimensional mesh: ignoring group 3 "outside_surfs"
Moving bulk elements to boundary elements
Leading bulk elementtype is 303
Trailing bulk elementtype is 202
There are 80 (out of 162994) lower dimensional elements.
Node 277 belongs to maximum of 8 elements
Found correctly 80 side elements.
Parent elements were reordered up to index 162914.
Moved 162914 elements (out of 162994) to new positions
Successfully read the mesh from the Gmsh input file.
